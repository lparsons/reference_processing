AnnotationSnakefile
-------------------

`AnnotationSnakefile` is a
[`Snakemake`](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake) file containing
rules for generating bacterial annotation files from NCBI GFF files.

NCBI GFF downloads: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/

Input:
#   `{organism}.gff` - GFF downloaded from NCBI
#   `{organism}.fasta` - Fasta sequence
#   `ORGANISMS` - List of organism names

Output:
#   `{organism}.gtf` - GTF file generated by 'gffread' from tophat package
#   `{organism}.bed` - BED12 file generated by converting the GTF file
#   `{organism}_parsed.gff` - GFF file generated by parsing NCBI GFF through 'gffread'
#       Note: GFF parsing sometimes fails with segmentation fault
#   `{organism}_gene_ids_unique_coverage.txt` - Gene ids along with amount of the
#       gene that is unambiguous with respect to other genes on the same strand.
#   `{organism}_gene_annotations.txt` - Gene annotations for each gene id

Utilities
---------

### `add_seqid_to_gff_id.py`

Add the sequence id to the ID (and Parent) attributes in a GFF file. This is
useful when there are multiple GFF files provided by NCBI that have duplicate
IDs (such as when they include a plasmid with a bacterial sequence).
